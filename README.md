# Multi-Router-Network
A Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrating multi-hop networking using three routers and static routing.
🚀 Configuring a Multi-Hop Network Using 3 Routers in Cisco Packet Tracer! 🛜
I recently built a hopping network using 3 routers (2621XM), 2 PCs, and multiple subnet connections in Cisco Packet Tracer. This project helped me understand IP addressing, static routing, and gateway configurations in a multi-router environment.

🌐 Project Overview:
✅ Configured three routers to interconnect different networks.
✅ Assigned unique IP subnets for efficient routing.
✅ Implemented static routing to enable communication between PCs.
✅ Set up default gateways to ensure smooth packet forwarding.
✅ Verified connectivity using ping and traceroute commands.

🔧 Technical Setup:
PC0: 192.168.1.2/24 → Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Router0 → Router1 → Router2 (Interconnected via /30 subnets)
PC1: 192.168.2.2/24 → Gateway: 192.168.2.1
Static Routes Configured: ip route commands for packet forwarding
🎯 Key Learnings:
🔹 Routing Concepts: Static routing ensures manual path selection.
🔹 Network Troubleshooting: Used ping and tracert for debugging.
🔹 Real-world Applications: This setup mimics enterprise multi-router networks.

💡 Next, I'll explore dynamic routing protocols like OSPF/EIGRP for scalability!
